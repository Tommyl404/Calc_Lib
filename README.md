# Calc_Lib - MATLAB Useful Functions

A MATLAB functions lib that have most of what a person needs.\
In this library you can find a wide variety of functions (which may also exist in one form or another) in MATLAB.

This library was written more for myself. One big library which brings together all the functions I've had to use so far (whether it's for calculating statistics, mathematical calculations, simple algorithms, etc.)

The library was created out of a need for more readable and debuggable code in an easier way for the user.
